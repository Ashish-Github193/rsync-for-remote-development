# Rsync for Remote Development Project

Welcome to the Rsync for Remote Development Project! This is a comprehensive project designed to facilitate easier synchronization, bootstrapping, and management of remote development environments using rsync. Whether you're working with a remote server or a virtual environment hosted elsewhere, this little toolkit will make your development workflow smoother and more efficient.

## Overview

This project contains several scripts designed to aid with remote development:

- `sync.sh`: Synchronizes local changes to the remote environment.
- `boot.sh`: Initiates the remote environment, ensuring it's up and running.
- `kill.sh`: Gracefully terminates any running instances in the remote environment.

Each script is tailored to streamline specific parts of the remote development workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You must have `rsync` installed on both your local machine and the remote server.
- SSH access to the remote server is required.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts on the remote server.

### Configuration

Before getting started, you'll need to configure the scripts to match your remote server's details. This involves setting up SSH keys (if not already done) and potentially modifying the scripts to point to the correct remote paths and server details.

### Usage

#### Syncing Files

To synchronize your local development files with the remote server, use the `sync.sh` script. This will ensure that your changes are mirrored remotely, allowing for seamless development.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Execute the script:
   ```
   ./sync.sh
   ```
4. Follow any on-screen instructions to complete the synchronization.

#### Bootstrapping the Environment

Before you can work remotely, you need to ensure the environment is running. Use the `boot.sh` script to start up any necessary services or applications on the remote server.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Execute the script:
   ```
   ./boot.sh
   ```
4. The script will start the environment and ensure everything is ready for development.

#### Killing the Remote Environment

When you're done with development, you might want to stop all running services or processes. The `kill.sh` script is designed for this purpose.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Execute the script:
   ```
   ./kill.sh
   ```
4. The script will terminate all running instances related to your remote development environment.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure that your SSH keys are correctly set up and that the remote server accepts your connection.
- Verify that `rsync` is correctly installed and accessible in your system's PATH on both your local and remote machines.
- If a script fails to execute, check its permissions. You might need to make it executable by running `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
